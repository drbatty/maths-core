# Maths Core #

A project containing basic mathematical classes including

- Sets
- Graphs
- Simplicial Complexes
- Sparse Vectors
- Complex Numbers

The library depends on my C# extensions library.

To build, create a new solution in visual studio and import the C# extensions project and this project (and the unit tests if you want). Let me know if you have any problems building it.

There is also a unit test project.
